<p><span class="title">tabulata</span> calculates and aggregates <strong>list-based
    data</strong>. Its function expressions are versatile and easy to read and use.</p>

<p>
    Currently, <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> exists as a functional prototype to explore some ideas I
    had to improve on the current spreadsheet/database divide. It takes its inspiration from
    <a href="http://www.lastcalc.com/" target="_blank">LastCalc</a> and
    <a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/" target="_blank">Soulver</a>, but the basic idea existed before I even
    knew about these products.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of work sheets with arbitrary coordinates-based addressing, <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> forces
    you to name everything which can be referenced and has an explicit concept of lists.
</p>

<p class="open-app">&rsaquo;&rsaquo; Open up <a href="http://tabulata.jit.su/" target="_blank">the application</a>
    now. It already contains some examples.</p>

    <p>The budget example is outlined below in more detail. It introduces the terminology and showcases the
        way <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> lets you manipulate <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>values</strong>
        and <strong>expressions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<div class="example">
    <div class="home-block-container"><div class="home-block-delete">×</div><div class="home-block-title">Budget</div><div class="home-block-lists">Control &nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget &nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions</div><dt>Total Spent</dt><dd>156.5</dd><dt>Total Budgeted</dt><dd>140</dd><dt>Number Of Transactions</dt><dd>5</dd><dt>Spent In Categories Over Budget</dt><dd>138.5</dd></div>
</div>

<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a collection of <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>singulars</strong>.
    It is displayed on the <strong>home screen</strong> in condensed form,
    as shown here. Selecting the block opens it for editing.</p>

<p>In a block, calculated values are displayed, the expression generating the value can be edited when
    the calculated value is clicked.</p>

<p>A singular associates a name with an expression. When the singular is <strong>starred</strong>, it appears in the
    condensed block on the home screen. To edit a singular, click the value.</p>

<p>A list is named and consists of columns. A <strong>column</strong> contains either values or an expression.
    Columns and rows are appended using the „+“-buttons.</p>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>In an expression,  <code>ListName.ColumnName</code> references the contained or calculated data in list form. On that
    <strong>list object</strong> functions like <code>sum</code>, <code>count</code> and <code>select</code> are called
    using <code>ListName.ColumnName.functionName</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>column expression</strong> is calculated for each row of the list. <code>ColumnName</code> accesses the
    corresponding value in the same row, <code>ColumnName.above</code> the value one row above. Singulars can be
    referenced.
</p>

<p>A <strong>list aggregation</strong> is created with an expression which returns a list in the first column. In the
    example <code>uniques</code> returns a list with each value of the referenced column contained once. Aggregated
    data is then calculated in the other columns by using <code>select</code> and <code>sum</code> over the other table
    columns.
</p>

<h2>Include External Data</h2>
<p>Using <strong>includes</strong>, external data sources can be directly accessed inside a block. Currently implemented
for arbitrary <code>JSON</code> APIs, once mapped to a name, the data inside the object tree can be used for creating
and manipulating lists. See the <strong>Currency Portfolio</strong> example.</p>

    <p class="open-app">&rsaquo;&rsaquo; Open up <a href="http://tabulata.jit.su/" target="_blank">the application</a>
        now. It contains the examples outlined here.</p>

<h2>Current Status, Future Plans, Contact</h2>
<p>Tabulata exists as a pleasure project of <a href="http://www.rutishauser.name/">Samuel Rutishauser</a> to
    play around with technologies and ideas. Its key premise lacks in ease of understanding and real improvement, thus
    I decided to cease active development.
