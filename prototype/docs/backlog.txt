QUICK FEATURES

Delete Singulars/Columns

Only show Pane when name is > size 1, with delay

Usability When adding elements to list (tab creates row)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUES

LOW only use jq data() , remove plain dataset access

MED touch-selecting: if holding longer than a bit (ie. click-event gets fired (working assumption)), then
the expression-editing field looses focus and the touched field gains the focus (bypassing the javascript
event handlers). intercepting and cancelling focus and click events did not help so far.

MED as long as a column doesn't have a name, it is not visible to the backend.

MED consolidate the different change-methods and event into 1

MED refactor frontend code to not use column/list/singular name as it makes the code more complicated
    than necessary.

MED "Sequence * 3" should probably work as a list expression

MED If in singulars ?

LOW in engine, use precise number library for calculations, number handling
