ISSUES

MED redis -> mongodb (hosted redis seems to drop documents)

LOW only use jq data() , remove plain dataset access

MED touch-selecting: if holding longer than a bit (ie. click-event gets fired (working assumption)), then
the expression-editing field looses focus and the touched field gains the focus (bypassing the javascript
event handlers). intercepting and cancelling focus and click events did not help so far.

MED as long as a column doesn't have a name, it is not visible to the backend.

MED consolidate the different change-methods and event into 1

MED refactor frontend code to not use column/list/singular name as it makes the code more complicated
    than necessary.

MED "Sequence * 3" should probably work as a list expression
    (-> when lv oder rv is list, apply binary functions to each item in list)

LOW split context into 2 objects:
    (a) EngineContext for functionality called by the engine,
    (b) ExecutionContext for functionality called during evaluation (in with (ctx))

MED in engine, use precise number library for calculations, number handling

MED improve frontend-code (use some library)

LOW make WebWorker-usable again.
