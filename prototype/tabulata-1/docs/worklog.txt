P The Beginning

A implementation of gui

+ 11. march

A gui

+ 12. march

A gui col-name, singular

+ 13. march

A implementation of calculation in the list
Q use a parser generator after all? - http://pegjs.majda.cz/documentation

+ 14. march

A playing with parser generator
D have to use a parser generator

+ 15. march

Q separation of javascript/mylan
D it should be separated (js parts in {})
Q should the grammar be strict (incl keywords etc)
  pro: better error detection, simpler
  con: extensibility
D for now, be strict
D revised: turned out to be naturally not strict
A written parser generator, works for the examples
A used parser to generate ast, use ast to output working javascript for example



+ 16. march

A engine passes test cases: calculates singular and column values
A also use parser for column values
A load block from file into gui
Q thoughts about the model/nature/kind of interaction between gui and calculation backend
-> event based (in-queue and out-queue, threaded)
-> transition based: the context doesn't change state but is applied a transition and
   generates a new context
-> something inbetween
requirements:
- collaboration must be feasible
- weak coupling (no direct object references)
- responsive gui
- extendable


+ 17. march

A further research:
  - web workers (threading) available on ios 5.1 and chrome -> good enough!
  - still both raw event and transition-based architecture open

D have a go at a event-based architecture


+ 18. march

A implemented web worker with events for loading, changing of column values
  changing of number column values works!

problem: implicit casting of values (number / boolean)

A problem solved: when updating a value (which is always a string), convert to proper value

Q how to proceed further.

A created and added to git repository.

19. march

A edit singular

20. march

A add row -- to backend and frontend

Q the "list" json datastructure is present on both the backend and frontend. who is master, if any ?
Q how to represent changes? (==> event/transition model from 16. march)
  for now, data is present in:
   - input fields in the gui (must, current)
   - json structure frontend (not current, used for loading)
   - json structure backend (not current, used for loading)
   - backend objects (must)

  together with a unified way to load/save data, this should be cleaned up
  also, will be a topic when defining meta data

D because i've now set up git, will not list activities resulting in code any more
