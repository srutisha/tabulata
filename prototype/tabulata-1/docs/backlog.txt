ISSUES

MED grammar: )_*_3 doesn't parse (whitespace after closed bracket)

LOW only use jq data() , remove plain dataset access

MED touch-selecting: if holding longer than a bit (ie. click-event gets fired (working assumption)), then
the expression-editing field looses focus and the touched field gains the focus (bypassing the javascript
event handlers). intercepting and cancelling focus and click events did not help so far.

MED consolidate the different change-methods and event into 1
