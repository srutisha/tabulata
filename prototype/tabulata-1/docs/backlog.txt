ISSUES

MED grammar: )_*_3 doesn't parse (whitespace after closed bracket)

LOW only use jq data() , remove plain dataset access

MED touch-selecting: if holding longer than a bit (ie. click-event gets fired (working assumption)), then
the expression-editing field looses focus and the touched field gains the focus (bypassing the javascript
event handlers). intercepting and cancelling focus and click events did not help so far.
