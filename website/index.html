<p><span class="title">tabulata</span> calculates and aggregates <strong>list-based
    data</strong>. Its function expressions are versatile and easy to read and use.</p>

<p>
    Currently, <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> exists as a functional prototype to explore some ideas I
    had to improve on the current spreadsheet metaphor. It takes some inspiration from
    <a href="http://www.lastcalc.com/" target="_blank">LastCalc</a> and
    <a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/" target="_blank">Soulver</a>, but the basic idea existed before I even knew about these products and was developed back in 2007.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of work sheets with arbitrary coordinates-based addressing, <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> forces
    you to name everything which can be referenced and has an explicit concept of lists.
</p>

<p class="open-app">&rsaquo;&rsaquo; Open up <a href="http://tabulata.jit.su/" target="_blank">the application</a>
    now. It already contains some examples. <br/>&rsaquo;&rsaquo; Note: Bookmark the URL you are redirected to for later retrieval.</p>

    <p>Read further to learn how <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> lets you manipulate <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>values</strong>
        and <strong>expressions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>


<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a collection of <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>singulars</strong>.
    It is displayed on the <strong>home screen</strong> in condensed form,
    as shown here. Selecting the block opens it for editing.</p>
    <img src="assets/Block.png" />
<p>In a block, calculated values are displayed, the expression generating the value can be edited when
    the calculated value is activated by clicking or tapping.</p>
    <img src="assets/singular.png" />
<p>A singular associates one name with one expression generating one resulting value. When the singular is <strong>starred</strong>, it appears in the
    condensed block on the home screen. To edit a singular, click the value.</p>
    <img src="assets/list.png" />
<p>A list is named and consists of named columns. A <strong>column</strong> contains either values or an expression.
    Columns and rows are appended using the „+“-buttons.</p>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>
    The heart of <span class="tabulata">tabulata</span> are the expressions which calculate singulars and
    expression columns. Any existing or calculated data is referenced exclusively by name, spaces are omitted, so <code>Tax Rate</code>
    as a name is referenced using the symbol <code>TaxRate</code>.
</p>

<p>In an expression,  <code>ListName.ColumnName</code> references the contained or calculated data in list form. On that
    <strong>list representation</strong> functions like <code>sum</code>, <code>count</code> and <code>select</code> are called
    using <code>ListName.ColumnName.functionName</code>.</p>

    <img src="assets/edit_exp.png" />

<p>A <strong>column expression</strong> is calculated for each row of the list. <code>ColumnName</code> accesses the
    corresponding value in the same row, <code>ColumnName.above</code> the value one row above. Singulars can be
    referenced. A simple example would be, for the column <code>Tax</code> the expression <code>Price * TaxRate</code>.
</p>

<p>A <strong>list aggregation</strong> is created using an expression which returns a list as the first column. Examples for expressions which return a list are <code>uniques</code> and <code>select</code>. <code>List.Column.uniques</code> returns a list with each distinct value of <code>Column</code> contained once. Aggregated data is then calculated in the other columns by using <code>select</code> and <code>sum</code> on arbitrary other columns.
</p>

<h2>Include External Data</h2>
<p>Using <strong>includes</strong>, external data sources can be directly accessed inside a block. Currently implemented
for arbitrary <code>JSON</code> APIs, once mapped to a name, the data inside the object tree can be used for creating
and manipulating lists. See the <strong>Currency Portfolio</strong> example.</p>
